STUPID FUCKING USELESS DRAFT [SFUD]
===================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
A "Heterogeneous System" is a system with multiple processors with some of them based on different instruction-set architecture (ISA) or micro-architecture. Usually, each processor excels at some aspect and performs poorly at another, and by combining them, we provide the best of each world. 
Heterogeneous systems are more complex than homogeneous ones, because processors have different architectures. That means they need more complex scheduling policies to utilize the different properties efficiently.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Our goal is to explore the possibility of providing more optimal scheduler policy for heterogeneous systems through 
heuristic parameter optimization methods like different machine learning [1] and/or genetic algorithms [2].
We plan to build a simulation for some popular heterogeneous system, and integrate our optimization technique to 
find better policy for different scenarios.

WHY
---
Because heterogeneous systems are relatively new concept, they lack good support from OS developers, 
and thus their schedulers policies still need more optimizations. 
Recent findings show that they, the heterogeneous systems, can achieve lower energy delay product over homogeneous systems as much as 21%-23% [3]. We assume that with more efficient scheduling they can achieve lower power consumption, and then they can become more economical.

* Why this paper: So we get insights into how to use machine learning in achieving better scheduling policies.
* Paper research problem: Heterogeneous systems task scheduling problem.
* Paper goal: Determining a more efficient scheduling policy for heterogeneous systems.
* Tools: BURLAP library, Java RMI API, remote allocated schedulers and WorkflowSim.
* Conclusion: The paper proposed a platform of scheduling solutions as a service based on machine learning agents. 
And found out that reinforcement learning has the limitation of with more nodes the system was incapable of learning optimal policy.
