STUPID FUCKING USELESS DRAFT [SFUD]
===================================

INTRO
-----
* what is heterogeneous system
* what is a scheduler
* hetero-sys is complex and different from homo-sys
    then hetero-sys needs different scheduling methods

PROBLEM
-------
* we will try to optimize their parameters 
    with one/multiple heuristic methods
    for some hetero-sys model

WHY
---
* hetero-sys are not popular, 
    so their scheduling algos are not mature,
    we want to make them better
* hetero-sys can lower the power consumption over homo-sys
    so with better scheduling, they can be more efficient,
    thus more economical

* Name: New Scheduling Approach using Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous Distributed Systems.
* Authors: Alexandru Iulian Orhean, Florin Pop, Ioan Raicu.
* Date: March 1, 2017
* Why we cite it: optimizes hetero-sys scheduling
* Paper research proplem: Hetero-sys task schedulering problem.
* Paper goal: determining a new scheduling policy for hetero-sys
* Tools: BURLAP library, Java RMI API, remote allocated schedulers and  WorkflowSim.
* Concolusion: 
    Ploatform of scheduling solutions as a service based on machine learning agents. 
    Learning model has limitations, with more nodes the system was incapable of learning optimal policy.

* Name: Genetic Algorithm approach to Operating system process scheduling problem.
* Authors: Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Er. Rajiv Kumar, Er. Sanjeev Gill, Er. Ashwani Kaushik.
* Date: September 2010
* Why we cite it: uses GA, a heuristic optimizing technique we may use.
* Paper research proplem: General-purpose OS task schedulig problem
* Paper goal: optimize scheduling parameters using GA
* Concolusion: GAâ€™s can provide a highly flexible and user-friendly, 
    near optimal solution to the general job sequencing problem.

* Name: Harnessing ISA Diversity: Design of a Heterogeneous-ISA Chip Multiprocessor
* Authors: Ashish Venkat, Dean M. Tullsen
* Date: 14 June 2014
* Why we cite it: we use it to understand hetero-sys
* Paper research proplem: Which is more effective, hetero-sys or homo-sys ?
* Paper goal: prove hetero-sys are more power efficent
* Concolusion: hetero-sys improves
    energy efficiency over the most efficient single-ISA design by 23%.
