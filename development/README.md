# Heterogeneous Systems Scheduling Research   

This folder contains the code for all experiments.

### Introduction

Job Scheduling in Heterogeneous Systems (HeDCS) are divided into two main categories based on their target metric:

- Application-Specific: where target is job execution speed (performance).
- System-Specific: where target is resource utilization.

### Paper Goal

Global - Static - Non-Physically Distributed - Heuristic - SubOptimal scheduling policy for better performance (resource utilization comparison to be done).

### Baseline

The proposed methods are to be compared to Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm, which is a well-established widely-used algorithm for HeDCS scheduling.

### Experiments 

1) Genetic Algorithms.

2) Neural Networks: __See the proposed network__.

3) Reinforcement Learning: Q-learning [OPTIONAL].

The best performing method is to be proposed mainly in the paper and compared to the others.
